        agreement between you (“User”, “you” or “your”) and this Website operator (“Operator”, “we”, “us” or “our”). If
        you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent that you have
        the authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the terms “User”, “you” or “your” shall refer

    <p style="color: white">Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they
        expire when you close the web browser.</p>
